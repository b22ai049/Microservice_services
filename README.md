Microservice-Based Application Deployment on VirtualBox VMs
This repository contains the source code and configuration files for deploying a microservice-based application across multiple VirtualBox VMs. The setup includes networking configurations, service deployment, and inter-VM communication.

Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to:

Create multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) using VirtualBox.
Configure network settings to enable communication between VMs.
Deploy a microservice-based application, such as a RESTful API or a Node.js-based service.
System Requirements
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

VirtualBox (latest version)
Vagrant (optional for automation)
Git
Docker (if using containerized services)
Node.js (for a Node.js-based microservice)
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Install VirtualBox and create multiple VMs.
Configure networking settings (Bridged, Host-Only, or NAT).
Assign static IP addresses to each VM.
Deploy microservices on the respective VMs.
Test communication between VMs using appropriate tools.
Network Configuration
VM Name	Role	IP Address	Services Running
VM1	Backend Service	192.168.1.101	REST API
VM2	Frontend/UI	192.168.1.102	React/Vue UI
VM3	Database Server	192.168.1.103	PostgreSQL/MySQL
Running the Application
Once deployed, the application can be tested by sending requests to the backend API or accessing the frontend service from a browser. For a Dockerized deployment, appropriate container management commands should be used.

Project Structure
The project includes separate directories for backend, frontend, and database configuration files. Additional documentation, such as architecture diagrams and networking configurations, are included in the repository.
